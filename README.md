## Inspiration:
RoomieMatch was inspired by the challenge of finding roommates who truly match your preferences and lifestyle, addressing the difficulty many face in this process.

## What it does:
RoomieMatch helps users connect with their community by facilitating the search for compatible roommates. It allows users to specify preferences such as location, gender, and age to find the ideal living situation.

## How we built it:
We built RoomieMatch using the MERN stack, with React for the frontend. MongoDB was chosen for the backend database to store user profiles and preferences.

## Challenges we ran into:
One of the main challenges we faced was implementing MongoDB for the backend server. Setting up the database structure and ensuring smooth integration with the frontend posed significant hurdles.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:
Despite the challenges, we were able to nearly complete the frontend development, achieving substantial progress in UI/UX design and functionality, except for the sign-in page.

## What we learned:
Through building RoomieMatch, we gained valuable insights into the complexities of developing a MERN stack application. We learned about effective strategies for structuring databases, handling user authentication, and optimizing frontend performance.

## What's next for RoomieMatch:
Moving forward, our plans for RoomieMatch include fully implementing MongoDB to support seamless user data management. We aim to introduce filtering options so users can refine their roommate searches based on criteria like location, gender, and age.
